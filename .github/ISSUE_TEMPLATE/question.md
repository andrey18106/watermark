Thanks for reporting issues back to Watermark!

# DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS, USE THE FORUMS

We use GitHub issues only to discuss about Watermark bugs and new features.

Watermark and its extras are explained in the [wiki](https://github.com/cloud_py_api/watermark/wiki).

For any other question or comment, please use the official Telegram support [chat](https://t.me/cloud_py_api_support).

Note that quite probably your question has an answer in the [FAQ](https://github.com/andrey18106/cloud_py_api/watermark/wiki/FAQ).

Thank you!
